charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord may incur by reason of Tenant's late

and remedies under this agreement, and as provided by law.

and to replace or return personal property or appurtenances exclusive of
ordinary wear and tear. If used toward rent or damages during the term of tenancy,
