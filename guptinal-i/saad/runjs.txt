To avoid triggering security popups associated with batch files, 
you can open a terminal window (cmd) to run jscript scripts 
using cscript command. To avoid memorizing the commands, 
put them into a text file like this and paste them into the 
terminal window. 

cd C:\Users\jchoy01\Documents\CompleteSpend\2015\CSreplace-ExpenseManager\Migration-of-HCP-HCO\HCP\output
